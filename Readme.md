This is the demo code for my 2015 SenchaCon talk at Santa Clara CA.

It uses wrappers around D3 components to test out structuring D3 code, adding inheritance and getting access to the MVVM ViewModels in ExtJS 5+.

Please note that this is demo code and not optimally structured. Most of the business logic should be implemented using ViewControllers.

Enjoy and let me know what you think. Don't forget to run a Sencha build first.
